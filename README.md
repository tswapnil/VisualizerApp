This app generates a visualization of my Favorite song - Tay Hai. 
The frequency of the music after having Fourier transformed is broken into three different sections in the ratio 10-30-60. 
The lower 10% of the frequency is displayed by a circle. The upper 30% is displayed by square. And the rest is displayed by a triangle.
This app also provides preferences to users to choose colors.
